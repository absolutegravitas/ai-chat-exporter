# AI Chat Exporter

Export your Gemini and ChatGPT conversations to perfectly formatted Markdown files with complete preservation of LaTeX math, code blocks, tables, and all formatting. Version 4.0.0 introduces DOM-based extraction for Gemini—eliminating clipboard dependencies for more reliable, privacy-friendly exports.

## Features

- **DOM-based extraction for Gemini (v4.0.0+)**: Direct HTML parsing without clipboard dependency using Turndown library
- Export your full Gemini or ChatGPT chat conversation to Markdown, preserving formatting (code, tables, LaTeX, etc.)
- Dedicated "Export Chat" button appears automatically on every Gemini and ChatGPT chat page
- Option to hide the export button via the extension popup
- **Granular message selection**: Use checkboxes next to each message to select exactly what to export
- **Selection presets**: Instantly select all, none, or only AI responses with a dropdown
- **Export to clipboard or file**: Copy your chat as Markdown directly to your clipboard—no file download needed, or save as .md file
- **Custom filename (optional)**: Enter a filename, or leave blank to use the chat title or a timestamp
- **Automatic lazy-loading**: Scrolls to load all messages in long conversations before export
- **Citation removal**: Automatically strips Gemini citation markers from exported content
- **Math formula support**: Preserves LaTeX equations from Gemini's `data-math` attributes
- Dark mode support: Export controls display correctly in both light and dark themes
- No build step required
- Open source under the Apache License 2.0

## What's New in v4.0.0

### 🎉 DOM-Based Extraction for Gemini
- **No more clipboard dependency**: Gemini exports now use direct DOM parsing with the Turndown library
- **More reliable**: Eliminates clipboard race conditions and retry logic
- **Better formatting**: Direct HTML-to-Markdown conversion preserves complex formatting
- **Math formula support**: Extracts LaTeX equations from Gemini's `data-math` attributes
- **Enhanced privacy**: Clipboard access no longer required for Gemini

### Technical Improvements
- Integrated [Turndown.js](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) for robust HTML→Markdown conversion
- Custom Turndown rules for math blocks, inline math, and tables
- Improved citation removal algorithm
- Fallback to manual DOM traversal if Turndown unavailable

### Migration Notes
- Old clipboard-based implementation preserved as `gemini_old.js`
- ChatGPT export unchanged (still uses clipboard method)
- All UI features maintained (checkboxes, selection presets, custom filenames)

## Usage

### Gemini
1. Go to [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and open any chat conversation.
2. Click the **Export Chat** button at the top right of the page.
3. In the export menu, use the **Select messages** dropdown to quickly select "All", "Only answers" (AI responses), or "None". You can also manually check/uncheck any message using the checkboxes on the right of each message. If you make a custom selection, the dropdown will show "Custom".
4. Choose your export mode:
   - **Export as file** (default): Downloads a Markdown (.md) file
   - **Export to clipboard**: Copies the conversation to your clipboard for pasting elsewhere
5. **(Optional)** Enter a custom filename, or leave blank to automatically use the conversation title or timestamp.
6. Click **Export Chat** again to start. The button will show "Exporting..." during the process.
7. The extension will:
   - Automatically scroll to load all messages in the conversation (including lazy-loaded older messages)
   - Extract content directly from the DOM (no clipboard needed!)
   - Convert formatting, tables, code blocks, and math formulas to Markdown
   - Remove Gemini citation markers like `[cite_start]` and `[cite:1,2,3]`
8. Your exported file will be named: `<conversation_title>_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` (e.g., `My_Conversation_2026-01-18_153012.md`)

**Supported formatting:**
- ✅ Text formatting (bold, italics, inline code)
- ✅ Headings (H1-H6)
- ✅ Code blocks with syntax highlighting markers
- ✅ Tables (converted to Markdown tables)
- ✅ Lists (ordered and unordered)
- ✅ Blockquotes
- ✅ Horizontal rules
- ✅ Math formulas (LaTeX from `data-math` attributes)
- ✅ Line breaks

**Not supported:**
- ❌ Canvas/drawing responses
- ❌ Embedded images
- ❌ File attachments

**Note:** All content is extracted directly from the DOM using the Turndown library, ensuring accurate formatting preservation without clipboard dependencies.

### ChatGPT
1. Go to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and open any chat conversation.
2. Click the **Export Chat** button at the top right of the page.
3. Use the checkboxes and selection dropdown to choose which messages to export, just like in Gemini.
4. **(Optional)** Enter a custom filename, or leave blank to use the chat title or timestamp.
5. Choose your export mode:
   - **Export as file** (default): Downloads a Markdown (.md) file
   - **Export to clipboard**: Copies the conversation to your clipboard
6. Click **Export Chat** again to start. The button will show "Exporting..." during the process.
7. The extension will:
   - Automatically scroll to load all messages in the conversation
   - Use ChatGPT's built-in copy button to extract formatted content
   - Compile all selected messages into Markdown format
8. Your exported file will be named: `<chat_title>_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` (e.g., `My_Chat_Title_2026-01-18_153012.md`)

**Note:** ChatGPT export uses clipboard-based extraction via the platform's native copy button to ensure perfect formatting preservation.

## Permissions

This extension requires **storage** permission for extension settings and **clipboardRead** permission for ChatGPT exports. 

**Important change in v4.0.0:** Gemini exports no longer require clipboard access! The extension now uses direct DOM-based extraction with the Turndown library to convert Gemini's HTML responses to Markdown. This provides:
- ✅ More reliable extraction (no clipboard race conditions)
- ✅ Better formatting preservation (direct HTML→Markdown conversion)
- ✅ Enhanced privacy (no clipboard access needed for Gemini)

ChatGPT still requires clipboard access as it uses the built-in copy button for reliable content extraction.
